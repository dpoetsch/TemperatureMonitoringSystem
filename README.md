# TemperatureMonitoringSystem

Project Overview
This project focuses on automating routines for registering temperatures and the locations where these measurements are taken.

Purpose
Data Insertion: Automated procedures to insert data into several tables (t_ecloc, t_ecvei, t_ecmap, and t_ectemp).
Temperature Validation: A trigger-based system to validate temperature levels, emphasizing the differences between previous and new temperature values.
Data Management: Various operations to manage and manipulate data in the aforementioned tables.
Context
The code appears to be part of a system that monitors or manages data related to locations, vehicles, mappings, and temperature. Specific functionalities include the validation of temperature changes, the automated insertion of data into tables, and the recording of temperature measurements at various locations.

Skills and Technologies Used
SQL: Procedures, Triggers, CRUD operations.
DBMS: Potentially Oracle, given the use of DBMS_OUTPUT.
Transaction Control: Using COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
